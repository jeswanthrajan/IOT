This project allows you to control home appliances using an ESP32 microcontroller and IoT technology (ThingSpeak).

How It Works

Open the Arduino IDE and load the provided code file.

Update the code with your Wi-Fi credentials:

const char* ssid = "YOUR_SSID";  
const char* password = "YOUR_PASSWORD";


Go to ThingSpeak
 and create an account.

Create a new IoT channel and note the API keys.

Connect your ESP32 device to ThingSpeak using the provided code.

Upload the code to your ESP32.

Once connected, you can control and monitor your appliances through the IoT cloud.
